        <p>Hello love, I know you are always tired from work and life but I know you're working hard 
            for your future. I will always be here for you, so if you're tired and stuff mag pahinga ka sa akin
            Palagi kitang inaaway at inaasar well its because I just love you so much. Kahit na inaasar mo ako
            and nakakalimutan e-update, to think that I made you cry for like 3 times already, I'm sorry about that.
            I am so confident when I'm with you. I feel like I can do anything and I feel like everything will be okay.
            When you love me I feel like I am floating, it feels so good. You will always be my favorite person.
            <b>I love you, Mitchie</b> I know na the time will come where both of us will be more busy and mawawalan ng 
            time for each other. Still kahit na ganon hindi naman kita ipagpapalit sa malapit, so wag mo rin ako ipagpalit. kasi kung Oo
            by that time I already know a lot of coding language and <strong>I am gonna ruin your kabet life. </strong> So yeah, I am gonna save up
            so I can see you, I just hope na you're not all talk ha, kasi seryoso talaga ako sayo Love. I am not doing this for fun or just because ikaw lang 
            yung nandyan, I want us to be the end game, I want us to get married. I am a mean person I admit that, so I apologize in advance if may
            away us na I might say something mean and something that might hurt you. Pero I know rin na there is no excuse for a bad behavior, so I will
            restrain my self as much as possible, I dont wanna lose you after all. <br> 
            <br>
            this is my first time doing an HTMl WEBSITE, I MEAN I did it in grade 12 pero I didnt really understand anything haha.
            So yeah this is what I wanted to send to you, thats why the clue is anyone can do it and anyone can make it. :>
            Looks like pag iniwan mo ko kada mag p-program ka, ako maiisip mo  HA HA HA. <strong>WAG MO AKONG IWAN, MAS MAHAL PA KITA KAY JESUS</strong>
            I am not really a sweet person or a romantic, pero ewan ko ba, pag sayo ang lambot lambot ko tapos hindi kita matiis, I can't resist the urge of letting you
             know how much I love you.  <br>
             <br>
             You always make my day, kulang talaga pag wala ka. Also sorry sa mga nagagawa ko na kinakagalit and overthink mo sorry loveeee
             hehe.  <i>I hope we will always stay this way, I hope I am your endgame.</i> <br>
             <br>
             <strong>I love you Mitchie.</strong>
